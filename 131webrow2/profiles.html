        <h1>WolfMan</h1>
        <p>a 1941 American horror film written by Curt Siodmak and produced and directed by George Waggner. The film stars Lon Chaney, Jr. in the title role, and features Claude Rains, Evelyn Ankers, Ralph Bellamy, Patric Knowles, Béla Lugosi, and Maria
          Ouspenskaya in supporting roles. The title character has had a great deal of influence on Hollywood's depictions of the legend of the werewolf.[2] The film is the second Universal Pictures werewolf film, preceded six years earlier by the less
          commercially successful Werewolf of London (1935).<br> Lon Chaney, Jr. would reprise his classic role as "The Wolf Man" in four sequels, beginning with Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man in 1943.</p>

        </a>

        <h1>Nosferatu</h1>
        <p>a 1922 German Expressionist horror film, directed by F. W. Murnau, starring Max Schreck as the vampire Count Orlok. The film, shot in 1921 and released in 1922, was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Various names and
          other details were changed from the novel: for instance, "vampire" became "Nosferatu" and "Count Dracula" became "Count Orlok".<br> Stoker's heirs sued over the adaptation, and a court ruling ordered that all copies of the film be destroyed.
          However, a few prints of Nosferatu survived, and the film came to be regarded as an influential masterpiece of cinema.<br> The film was released in the United States on 3 June 1929, seven years after its original premiere in Germany.</p>

        <h1>The Creature</h1>
        <p>is a 1954 American black-and-white 3D monster horror film from Universal-International, produced by William Alland, directed by Jack Arnold, that stars Richard Carlson, Julia Adams, Richard Denning, Antonio Moreno, and Whit Bissell. The Creature
          was played by Ben Chapman on land and by Ricou Browning underwater. The film premiered in Detroit on February 12 and was released on a regional basis, opening on various dates.<br> Creature from the Black Lagoon was filmed in 3D and originally
          projected by the polarized light method. The audience wore viewers with gray polarizing filters, similar to the viewers most commonly used today. Because the brief 1950s 3D film fad had peaked in mid-1953 and was fading fast in early 1954, many
          audiences actually saw the film "flat", in 2D. Typically, the film was shown in 3D in large downtown theaters and flat in smaller neighborhood theaters. In 1975 Creature from the Black Lagoon was re-released to theaters in the inferior red-and-blue-glasses
          anaglyph 3D format, which was also used for a 1980 home video release on Beta and VHS videocassettes.<br>

        <h1>Mr. Hide</h1>
        <p>a 1931 American pre-Code horror film, directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Fredric March, who plays a possessed doctor who tests his new formula that can unleash people's inner demons. The film is an adaptation of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll
          and Mr Hyde, the 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson tale of a man who takes a potion which turns him from a mild-mannered man of science into a homicidal maniac. March's performance has been much lauded, and earned him his first Academy Award.</p>
